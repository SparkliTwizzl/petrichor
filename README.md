## 1 - What is it?

This tool is a command-line app with miscellaneous utilities. Currently wi're the only maintainer, so currently it only has stuff that wi feel the need to add to it.

---

## 2 - What does it do?

Currently the only utility it supports is generating AutoHotkey scripts to replace short sequences of text (tags) with longer strings with names, pronouns, and similar information. These scripts can be written by hand, but learning how to use AutoHotkey is required, and they're hard to make changes to if you ever want to, for example, change your name or your pronouns.

---

## 3 - AutoHotkey? What's that?

The scripts generated by the tool do nothing on their own. They are intended to be run with [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com), a Windows scripting tool intended for automation, and without it, they're just a glorified text file.

---

## 4 - How do i use it?

In order to get a useful result from the tool, there are 3 main steps:

1. Write an input file.
2. Run the tool using the above.
3. Run the resulting script with AutoHotkey.

---

### 4.1 - Input files

Input files are made up of 3 regions: Metadata, entries, and templates.

Blank lines in input files are ignored, so use as many as you want.

---

#### 4.1.1 - Metadata

This region is optional. It allows you to set custom icons on the shortcut script if desired.

##### 4.1.1.1 - Custom icons

If desired, you can specify filepaths to custom icons for the shortcut script to use.

To set the default icon, add a token to the metadata region called `default-icon` and set its value to the path to the icon file you want to use.

If you want a different icon to be used when the script is suspended, add a token to the metadata region called `suspend-icon` and set its value to the path to the icon file you want to use.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you move an icon file and do not update its path in your input file and regenerate the script, the icon will not be found by AutoHotkey and will not be applied.

Example:

```
metadata:
{
    default-icon: {path to default icon file}.ico
    suspend-icon: {path to suspend icon file}.ico
}
```

For simplicity, if an icon file will be in the same folder as the shortcut script, you can use a relative path (see 4.2.3 below for more on how relative paths work).

Example:

```
metadata:
{
    default-icon: ./{default icon file name}.ico
    suspend-icon: ./{suspend icon file name}.ico
}
```

##### 4.1.1.2 - Keyboard shortcut to reload script

If desired, you can include a keyboard shortcut to reload the script.

To include a reload shortcut, add a token to the metadata region called `reload-shortcut` and set its value to a valid AutoHotkey v2.0 shortcut string; If you do not know how to write one, consult AutoHotkey documentation.

Example:

```
metadata:
{
    reload-shortcut: #r ; Windows key + R
}
```

##### 4.1.1.3 - Keyboard shortcut to suspend script

If desired, you can include a keyboard shortcut to toggle suspending the script. Suspending the script will prevent macros from working until it is resumed.

To include a suspend shortcut, add a token to the metadata region called `suspend-shortcut` and set its value to a valid AutoHotkey v2.0 shortcut string; If you do not know how to write one, consult AutoHotkey documentation.

Example:

```
metadata:
{
    suspend-shortcut: #s ; Windows key + S
}
```

---

#### 4.1.2 - Entries are blocks of data which are made up of fields

Each entry represents a person and must contain at least one identity (a name paired with a tag).

To write an entry, start with an open curly brace `{` on one line and a close curly brace `}` on another, with nothing else on those lines.

Example:

```
{
}
```

##### 4.1.2.1 - Between the braces, write the fields for the entry on separate lines

Whitespace at the start of lines for fields is ignored, so feel free to indent or not as you prefer to.

Fields are identified by marker symbols:

- `#name#`
  - Name fields are a sub-field of identity fields (see below).
  - Name fields must be surrounded on both sides by hash symbols `#`.
  - Note that this means that name fields cannot contain hash symbols.
- `@tag`
  - Tag fields are a sub-field of identity fields (see below).
  - Tag fields cannot contain spaces.
- `$pronoun`
  - Pronoun fields are optional.
  - Entries cannot have more than one pronoun field.
- `&decoration`
  - Decoration fields are optional.
  - Entries cannot have more than one decoration field.

Identity fields are a special case, as they consist of pairs of name and tag fields:

- `% #name# @tag`
  - Every entry must contain at least one identity field.
  - There is no upper limit to how many identity fields an entry can have.

Example:

```
{
  % #Sam# @sm
  $they/them
  &-- a person
}
```

##### 4.1.2.2 - There's no limit on how many entries an input file can have, and entries and fields dont have to be unique

If you want to, for example, have the same set of names paired with a different pronoun and/or decoration, you can include multiple entries that are the same aside from small changes (see below).

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** All tag fields *should* be unique in order for the generated script to work correctly, even though Petrichor wont take issue with it. If a tag field is repeated, only the first one in the script will work.

Example:

```
entries:
{
  {
    % #Sam# @sm
    % #Sammy# @smy
  }
  {
    % #Sam# @sm-t
    % #Sammy# @smy-t
    $they/them
    &-- a person
  }
  {
    % #Sam# @sm-h
    % #Sammy# @smy-h
    $he/him
    &-- a person
  }
  {
    % #Sam# @sm-s
    % #Sammy# @smy-s
    $she/her
    &-- a person
  }
}
```

---

#### 4.1.3 - Templates are how the tool converts entries into AutoHotkey macros

In order for Petrichor to know what format(s) you want the macros in your script to have, you need to provide templates for them.

##### 4.1.3.1 - Templates must use the same basic structure in order for the generated script to work

All templates have to start with 2 colons `::`, a string of text including an at sign `@` representing the tag, then 2 more colons `::`.

The tag string can be anything you want, as long as it contains at least one at sign `@` and no spaces. Additional text is optional.

If this is not followed, the generated script wont work, even though Petrichor will run without errors.

Example:

```
templates:
{
  ::@:: ← the rest of the template must come after this
}
```

##### 4.1.3.2 - Templates must contain marker symbols for the tool to replace in order for them to do anything

Certain symbols will be replaced by fields from entries in the input file by default. This is how templates are able to be used to generate macros.

Below is a list of the marker symbols and the fields they will be replaced by when the tool runs:

- `# → name`
- `@ → tag`
- `$ → pronoun`
- `& → decoration`

Example:

```
entries:
{
  {
    % #Sam# @sm
    % #Sammy# @smy
    $they/them
    &-- a person
  }
}

templates:
{
  ::@::# ($) | [&]
}
```

This produces this output file:

```
::sm::Sam (they/them) | [-- a person]
::smy::Sammy (they/them) | [-- a person]
```

##### 4.1.3.3 - You can use each marker symbol in a template as many times as you want

Example:

```
entries:
{
  {
    % #Sam# @sm
    % #Sammy# @smy
    $they/them
    & is a person
  }
}

templates:
{
  ::@@::# ($) | [#&]
}
```

This produces this output file:

```
::smsm::Sam (they/them) | [Sam is a person]
::smysmy::Sammy (they/them) | [Sammy is a person]
```

##### 4.1.3.4 - You can use a backslash `\`, aka an "escape character", to use marker symbols without them being replaced

Note that you can apply an escape character to a backslash in order to make it print literally.

Example:

```
entries:
{
  {
    % #Sam# @sm
    % #Sammy# @smy
    $they/them
    &a person
  }
}

templates:
{
  ::\@@::# ($) \\ [\#&]
}
```

This produces this output file:

```
::@sm::Sam (they/them) \ [#a person]
::@smy::Sammy (they/them) \ [#a person]
```

##### 4.1.3.5 - The templates region can have as many templates as you want

Although templates dont have to be unique, repeating a template will generate duplicate macros, which could break the generated script.

Example:

```
entries:
{
  {
    % #Sam# @sm
    % #Sammy# @smy
    $they/them
    &-- a person
  }
  {
    % #Alex# @ax
    $it/its
    &[a person too]
  }
  {
    % #Raven# @rvn
    $thon/thons>they/them
  }
  {
    % #Beck# @bk
  }
}

templates:
{
  ::\@@::#
  ::\@@-::# ($)
  ::<\@@>::# ($) | [&]
}
```

This produces this output file:

```
::@sm::Sam
::@sm-::Sam (they/them)
::<@sm>::Sam (they/them) | [-- a person]
::@smy::Sammy
::@smy-::Sammy (they/them)
::<@smy>::Sammy (they/them) | [-- a person]
::@ax::Alex
::@ax-::Alex (it/its)
::<@ax>::Alex (it/its) | [[a person too]]
::@rvn::Raven
::@rvn-::Raven (thon/thons>they/them)
::<@rvn>::Raven (thon/thons>they/them) || []
::@bk::Beck
::@bk-::Beck ()
::<@bk>::Beck () || []
```

### 4.2 - Running the tool

#### 4.2.1 - Call the executable (`.exe` file) via command line to run it

It's easier to write a batch script (.bat file) to do this for you (see below for how to do this). If you call it with no arguments, it will show helptext explaining how to use it.

Example:

```
{path to tool folder}\Petrichor\
>Petrichor.exe
```

#### 4.2.2 - Generating AutoHotkey shortcut scripts (generateAHKShortcutScript command)

To generate an AutoHotkey shortcut script, call Petrichor with the command argument `generateAHKShortcutScript`. This command has several options, some of which are required, which are explained below.

**Example:**

```
{path to tool folder}\Petrichor\
>Petrichor.exe generateAHKShortcutScript
```

##### 4.2.2.1 - generateAHKShortcutScript command `--input` option (REQUIRED)

Add the `--input` option to the `generateAHKShortcutScript` command and pass the path to the input file after it. You must include the path and the file extension for the input file. Relative file paths can be used (see 4.2.3).

Example:

```
{path to tool folder}\Petrichor\
>Petrichor.exe generateAHKShortcutScript --input C:\path\to\input\file\inputFile.txt
```

##### 4.2.2.2 - generateAHKShortcutScript command `--output` option

Add the `--outout` option to the `generateAHKShortcutScript` command and pass the output file after it.

The output file can be either a full filepath or just a filename. In the case of the latter, the output file will be created in a default location.

A file extension is not required, and if one is included it will be replaced with `.ahk` automatically. Relative file paths can be used (see 4.2.3).

**Example (full filepath, specify output location):**

```
{path to tool folder}\Petrichor\
>Petrichor.exe generateAHKShortcutScript --input {input file} --output C:\path\to\output\file\outputFile

RESULT:

C:\path\to\output\file\outputFile.ahk ← will be generated by Petrichor
```

**Example (filename only, default output location):**

```
{path to tool folder}\Petrichor\
>Petrichor.exe generateAHKShortcutScript --input {input file} --output outputFile

RESULT:

C:\path\to\tool\folder\Petrichor\_output\outputFile.ahk ← will be generated by Petrichor
```

##### 4.2.2.3 - generateAHKShortcutScript command `--logMode` option

This option is used to control where logs are sent.

Values for this option are:

- `none` - disable logging (default)

- `consoleOnly` - send logs only to console output

- `fileOnly` - send logs onto to log file

- `all` - send logs to all output locations

##### 4.2.2.4 - generateAHKShortcutScript command `--logFile` option

This option is used to customize the file name and/or location to generate a log file at.

NOTE: log file will only be created if logging to file is enabled (see 4.2.2.3).

**Example (filename only, default directory):**

```
Petrichor.exe generateAHKShortcutScript --input {input file} --logMode all --logFile logFile.txt

RESULT:

{path}/Petrichor/_log/logFile.txt ← will be generated by Petrichor
```

**Example (directory path only, default filename):**

```
Petrichor.exe generateAHKShortcutScript --input {input file} --logMode all --logFile {log path}/

RESULT:

{log path}/{yyyy}-{MM}-{dd}_{HH}-{mm}-{ss}.log ← will be generated by Petrichor
```

**Example: (full filepath, no defaults):**

```
Petrichor.exe generateAHKShortcutScript --input {input file} --logMode all --logFile {log path}/logFile.txt

RESULT:

{log path}/logFile.txt ← will be generated by Petrichor
```

#### 4.2.3 - If you dont like having to get the full path for files, you can use relative paths instead

`./` gets the folder the .exe file is in, and `../` gets the parent folder of that folder.

**Example:**

```
FOLDER CONTENTS:

- parent/
  - Petrichor/
    - outputFile.ahk (will be generated after running)
    - Petrichor.exe
  - inputFile.txt


IN COMMAND PROMPT:

{path to tool folder}\Petrichor\
>Petrichor.exe generateAHKShortcutScript --input ../inputFile.txt --output ./outputFile
```

#### 4.2.4 - A note about slashes in paths

On Windows, backslashes `\` and forward slashes `/` both work the same way. Use whichever you prefer to. They are not equivalent to each other in input files, however.

#### 4.2.5 - You can make a batch script (.bat file) to run the tool for you

If you're going to run the tool with the same arguments every time, it's much simpler to write a simple .bat file to run the tool for you.

##### 4.2.5.1 - Make a new text file, name it whatever you want, and change its extension to `.bat`

You can also open it in a text editor such as Notepad and use `save as → Batch file` to do the same thing.

##### 4.2.5.2 - Open the file in a text editor program, such as Notepad

##### 4.2.5.3 - In the file, put in the command usage as shown above, then save it

**Example:**

```
FOLDER CONTENTS:

- parent\
  - Petrichor\
    - _log\
      - (log files will be generated here after running the tool if logging is enabled)
    - Petrichor.exe
  - example batch file.bat
  - inputFile.txt
  - outputFile.ahk (will be generated after running the tool)


IN FILE "example batch file.bat":

Petrichor\Petrichor.exe generateAHKShortcutScript --input ..\inputFile.txt --output ..\outputFile

```

##### 4.2.5.4 - Once you've done all that, run the .bat file by double clicking it

Assuming the .bat file was made correctly, it will run Petrichor with all the arguments you set.

---

## 5 - Using the script generated by Petrichor

### 5.1 - Before you can do anything with your script, you need to install AutoHotkey v2

Download it [here](https://www.autohotkey.com) and install it, then continue.

### 5.2 - Now that AutoHotkey is installed, you need to run the script

Either double-click the .ahk file or right click on it and click "run script" in the dropdown menu.

### 5.3 - Having to launch the script every time you boot your computer can get annoying

If you get sick of it, you can follow the directions [here](https://windowsloop.com/run-autohotkey-script-at-windows-startup/) to make it run automatically. It might still sometimes fail to launch, but it works the majority of the time.
