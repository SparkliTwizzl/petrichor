## [Text Shortcut Script Generation](text-shortcut-script-generation-module/overview.md)

This module allows you to generate a text shortcut script (aka "find and replace" script) with a Petrichor Script input file.

Scripts generated by this module can be used to automatically insert long strings of text with short key sequences.

The main benefit is to reduce typing without needing to rely on copy-and-pasting.
