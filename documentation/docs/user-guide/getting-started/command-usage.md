## Commands

Petrichor modules each have a corresponding command to trigger them.

These can be given as command line arguments, or they can be [put into your input file](petrichor-script.md/#command-token) and Petrichor will attempt to read ane execute them automatically.


---
### Default command

You can run Petrichor without passing it a command if you put the command in your input file and pass the input file as an argument when you run it.

You can also just drag-and-drop the input file onto the executable ( `.exe` file ).

If no arguments are provided, you will be prompted to use the `--help` option to see usage and available commands.

???+ example

    ```powershell
    Petrichor.exe --help
    ```


---
### Module commands

Modules have unique command syntax and supported options.

See the relevant module's documentation for more information.


---
### Command options

Commands can have their behavior modified with options.

Some commands have unique options.


---
#### Input file option

Command line syntax: `#!powershell --inputFile <file>`

Petrichor Script syntax: `#!ptcr input-file : <file>`

The `input file` option allows you to specify the input file directory and/or name.

[Relative file paths](#relative-file-paths) can be used.

!!! note

    If you only provide the directory, `input.petrichor` will be used as the file name.

!!! note

    If you only provide the file name, `{install path}\` will be used as the directory.

???+ important "Restrictions"

    OPTIONAL

    In Petrichor Script, must be within [`command`](./petrichor-script.html#command-token) token body.

    If there are spaces in the argument, it must be surrounded by quotes ( `"` ).

    You must include the file extension if you provide a file name.

???+ example

    === "Command line"

        === "File name only, default directory"

            ```powershell
            Petrichor.exe commandName --inputFile "inputFile.txt"
            ```
            Petrichor will look for "{install path}\inputFile.txt".

        === "Directory only, default file name"

            ```powershell
            Petrichor.exe commandName --inputFile "[path]\"

## Running Petrichor via terminal

Call the executable ( `.exe` file ) via a terminal (command prompt) to run it.

If you run Petrichor with no arguments, it will prompt you to use the `--help` option to see available commands.

???+ example

    ```powershell
    [install path]> Petrichor.exe --help
    ```


---
## Running Petrichor via Batch file

If preferred, you can create a Batch file ( `.bat` file ) to run Petrichor for you.

1. Make a new text file, name it whatever you want, and change its extension to `.bat`.
    -  You can also open it in a text editor such as Notepad and use `save as â†’ Batch file` to do the same thing.
2. Open the file in a text editor program, such as Notepad.
3. Type `start {install path}/Petrichor.exe`, followed by command usage as shown above.
4. Save the batch file.

Once you've done these steps, you can run the `.bat` file by double clicking it.

Assuming the `.bat` file was made correctly, it will run Petrichor with all the arguments you set.

???+ example

    ```txt title="Folder contents"
    - parent\
        - Petrichor\
            - Petrichor.exe
        - example batch file.bat
        - inputFile.txt
    ```

    === "Command in command line arguments"

        ```batch title="example batch file.bat"
        start Petrichor\Petrichor.exe commandName --inputFile {path}\inputFile.txt
        ```

    === "Command in input file"

        ```batch title="example batch file.bat"
        start Petrichor\Petrichor.exe {path}\inputFile.txt
        ```


---
## Relative file paths

If you dont like having to get the full path for files, you can use relative paths instead.

`./` gets the folder the .exe file is in, and `../` gets the parent folder of that folder.

!!! warning

    Relative paths can cause headaches if you dont use them right.

    Relative paths in a [Batch script](#running-petrichor-via-batch-file) are by default relative to the Batch file they are in.

    Relative paths in a [terminal](#running-petrichor-via-terminal) are by default relative to Petrichor.exe.
    
    If Petrichor.exe is [added to your PATH environment variable](#adding-petrichor-to-windows-path-environment-variable), relative paths used with Petrichor.exe in either place are relative to the input file.


???+ example

    ```txt title="Folder contents"
    - folder/
        - subfolder/
            - you are here.txt
            - example a.txt
        - example b.txt
    ```

    ```txt title="Relative paths and equivalent absolute paths"
    "./example a.txt" -> "folder\subfolder\example a.txt"
    "../example b.txt" -> "folder\example b.txt"
    ```

---

## A note about slashes in file paths

On Windows, backslashes ( `\` ) and forward slashes ( `/` ) both work the same way in file paths.

Use whichever you prefer to.

!!! warning

    Backslashes and forward slashes are not equivalent to each other in Petrichor Script.

---
## Adding Petrichor to Windows PATH environment variable

In order to run Petrichor more easily, you can add its install path to the Windows PATH environment variable.

If you do this, you can run Petrichor without needing to navigate to its install folder or put its full install path into the terminal.

1. Navigate to your Petrichor install folder.
2. Copy the folder path.
3. Open the Start Menu.
4. Search for "environment variables".
5. Open `Edit the system environment variables`.
6. Click the `Environment Variables` button.
7. Select the `Path` variable.
    - Within the `User` variables to set locally (RECOMMENDED).
    - Within the `System` variables to set globally.
8. Click the `Edit` button.
9.  Click the `New` button.
10. Paste the folder path you copied in step 2.
11. Click the `OK` button.

???+ example

    === "Default behavior"

        ```txt
        C:\path\to\install\folder\Petrichor.exe commandName
        ```

    === "With Petrichor added to PATH variable"

        ```txt
        Petrichor.exe commandName
        ```
