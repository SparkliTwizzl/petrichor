---
## Requirements

The requirements to run a text shortcut script generated by Petrichor are listed below.


---
### AutoHotkey

The scripts that this module generates are AutoHotkey v2 scripts. In order to run them, you will need to install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com).


---
## Running text shortcut scripts

With AutoHotkey installed, simply double-click the script ( `.ahk` file ), or right-click it and click `run` in the context menu.

---
## Automatically run scripts after generating them

You can make a [batch script](../../getting-started/command-usage.md/#running-petrichor-via-batch-file) wait for Petrichor to finish running and launch the output script automatically.

1. Create a batch script using the steps linked above.
2. After the `start` keyword, add `/wait`. This will cause the batch script to wait until Petrichor is closed before continuing.
3. Add a new line to the batch script, and enter `start [path/script.ahk]`.
4. Save the batch file.

Once you've done these steps, you can run the `.bat` file by double clicking it. Assuming the `.bat` file was made correctly, it will run Petrichor with all the arguments you set, wait until it closes, then launch the output script.

**NOTE:** If Petrichor fails to generate a new script, any existing version of the output script will be launched instead.

**Example (Command in command line arguments):**

FOLDER CONTENTS:
```
- parent\
	- Petrichor\
		- Petrichor.exe
	- example batch file.bat
	- inputFile.txt
```
IN FILE `example batch file.bat`:
```batch
start /wait Petrichor\Petrichor.exe commandName --inputFile ..\inputFile.txt
start outputFile.ahk
```

**Example (Command in input file):**

FOLDER CONTENTS:
```
- parent\
	- Petrichor\
		- Petrichor.exe
	- example batch file.bat
	- inputFile.txt
	- outputFile.ahk (will be generated after running)
```
IN FILE `example batch file.bat`:
```batch
start /wait Petrichor\Petrichor.exe ..\inputFile.txt
start outputFile.ahk
```
